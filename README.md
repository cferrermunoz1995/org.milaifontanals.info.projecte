App developed in java to sim a desktop app to manage routes.

Has multiple projects, each one of them containig one component of the app.

First of all we have two scripts:
- One to create the strcuture and add the triggers to control the info
- Another insertinf demo data

We have the interface project that defines the methods our connection class must have.

We also have the connection class implementing the interface. We used Oracle to store our data.

We have the model project containing the different classes we will use in our app.

We have the desktop app project using the other projects.
